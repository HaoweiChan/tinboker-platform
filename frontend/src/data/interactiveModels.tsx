          The electric vehicle (EV) battery market is undergoing a significant structural shift as major manufacturers
          seek to diversify their supply chains away from single-source dependencies. Recent regulatory changes in the
          EU and North America have accelerated this trend, pushing automotive giants to forge new upstream alliances.

          <strong>Key Developments:</strong> Our analysis of recent procurement contracts reveals a tightening web of
          dependencies surrounding CATL and BYD. While these entities remain dominant, legacy automakers like
          Volkswagen and Ford are aggressively financing new mining operations in Australia and South America to bypass
          traditional refining bottlenecks.

          the high &quot;betweenness centrality&quot; of mid-stream refiners, which serve as potential choke points. A
          disruption in these nodes, indicated by the red warning markers in our model, could cascade downstream to
          multiple OEMs simultaneously.
