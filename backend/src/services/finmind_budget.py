"""
FinMind free-tier request budget.

FinMind's registered free tier caps API usage at a fixed number of HTTP requests
per clock-hour (≈600/hr; configurable via FINMIND_HOURLY_CAP). We have no contractual
headroom, so every FinMind HTTP call must be counted and hard-capped — otherwise a
launch-day traffic spike silently exhausts the quota and every TW stock page degrades
to "no data" for the rest of the hour.

This module is a process-safe, Redis-backed fixed-window counter:
- The window key is the current UTC clock-hour, so it auto-resets without a cleanup job.
- It is intentionally *sync* (redis-py, not aioredis) because the FinMind client runs
  inside `run_in_executor` worker threads.
- If Redis is unavailable it falls back to a per-process in-memory counter (fail-soft):
  we still cap each worker process rather than removing the cap entirely.

Set the cap BELOW the real ceiling (default 500 against a 600 limit) to leave headroom
for clock skew and any un-instrumented call path.
