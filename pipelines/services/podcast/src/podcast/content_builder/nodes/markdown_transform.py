"""Markdown transform node: converts structured writer output to markdown.

Section heading timestamps (``#time:ms``) are anchored DETERMINISTICALLY to the
real millisecond offsets the clusterer computed from the transcript — never to
the value the writer LLM echoes back. The model reliably preserves section
ORDER, but it is unreliable at transcribing 6-digit millisecond numbers: it has
historically emitted section ordinals (``#time:1``, ``#time:2`` …) or omitted the
field entirely, which surfaced on the site as chapters stuck at 00:00 or summary
chapters silently falling back to raw transcript sentences. Code owns the
timestamp; the LLM owns the prose. ``build_events_markdown`` already anchors the
same way — this keeps the summary path consistent with it.

    The writer emits one section per clustered (already financial-filtered) event,
    in the order it received them, so the base mapping is positional:
    ``sections[i] -> cluster_starts[i]``. Two refinements harden it against the LLM
    merging or adding sections:

    - If the writer echoed a ``start_time`` that EXACTLY matches a known cluster
      start, trust it (covers the writer reordering sections).
    - Positional assignment is clamped to the available range and forced
      monotonic non-decreasing, so chapters never jump backwards.

    Returns ``None`` for a section when no real offset exists (e.g. the clusterer
    produced no timed events) so the caller omits the marker instead of emitting a
    bogus 00:00.
